# finalproject

## Narrative:
The application that I'm planning on creating is focused on modeling an e-commerce business that sells shoes. I will model the steps a customer takes to find a product, select a product, add it to their cart, and then finalize the order by purchasing. I will also allow admin to add products to our list of products and remove products after certain products go out of stock.

## Use cases:
* user log in/log out
* admin log in/log out
* update admin/user
* create admin/user
* delete admin/user
* read all admins/users
* update order status
* read date purchased

## Relational Schema

* Customer: jdoe12@aol.com | 1234

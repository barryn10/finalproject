## Narrative:
The application that I’m planning to create will ultimately predict a certain style shoe based on information provided by the user. The user will provide information by answering a few questions that will basically take into account the user’s height, weight, and body type. The application will primarily deal with suggesting basketball shoes. So, the application will take into account whether the shoe should be low, mid, or high top for the user. The system will also give a suggested weight for the shoe in a general fashion basically stating whether it should be light, medium, or heavy. I will use html to basically illustrate what the user interface of this application would look like. Each user will have a unique id and password.

## Use cases: 
* user log in/log out
* admin log in/log out
* update admin/user 
* create admin/user
* delete admin/user 
* read all admins/users
* update credentials
